<p> 
	My name is Darren Webb. I attended Old Dominion University in Norfolk.Virgnia where I majored in Business Admin. After college I moved to New York and and got a job working in finance. I quickly realized the corporate lifestyle was not for me and after a year I started a night life ticketing company YourPartyHub.com. During that time I was fully immersed in being an entrepreneur and creator. </p>

<P> I became the Director of Entrepreneur Week, a non-profit organization 	  that brought entrepreneurs and investors together world wide through 		a week long event series. Entrepreneur Week allowed me to see 			entrepreneurship through a different lense, as I was able to travel 	the world to developing countries and witness how hungry and intense 	 burgeoning entrepreneurs were in these regions with limited resources. </p>
<p> I lived in Palo Alto, California the heart of Silicon Valley for 8 		months in 2013 networking and meeting entrepreneurs who were out to  	 change the world. These experiences lead me to Startup Institute 		where we are taught specific skills to not only further our skills 		but skills to help make the lives of others better through 				development and technology. </p>
