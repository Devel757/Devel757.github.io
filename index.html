<p> 
	My name is Darren Webb. I attended Old Dominion University in Norfolk.Virgnia where I majored in Business Admin. After college I moved to New York and and got a job working in finance. I quickly realized that the corporate environment was not for me and after a year I started a night life ticketing company, YourPartyHub.com. During that time I was fully immersed within being an entrepreneur and creator. </p>

<P> I became the Director of New York Entrepreneur Week, a non-profit organization that brought entrepreneurs and investors together world wide through a week long event series. Entrepreneur Week allowed me to see entrepreneurship through a different scope, as I was able to travel the world visiting developing countries and witness how hungry and intense 	burgeoning entrepreneurs were in these regions even with limited resources they had. </p>
<p> I lived in Palo Alto, California the heart of Silicon Valley for 10 months in 2013 networking and meeting entrepreneurs who were out to change the world. These experiences lead me to Startup Institute where we are taught specific skills to not only further our careers but skills to help make the lives of others better through 				development and technology. </p>
